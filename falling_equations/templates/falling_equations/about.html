    <p>1. To play the game, you need to have an account and be<a href="{% url 'login' %}" class="pl-2 text-info">logged in.</a></p>
    <p>2. Click "Game" on menubar to navigate to the game.</p>
    <p>3. Press "Enter" and the game will start.</p>
    <p>4. Gameplay explanation:</p>
    <p>- Blocks with equations assigned to them fall from above. Your task is to enter the result of these equations
        on the keyboard and then launch it into the block directions.</p>

    <p>- When the result you enter is correct and you hit the block, the equation will explode. You will get 50 points,
        and the equation itself will break into individual fragments. Watch out! When any of them hits you, you will lose one life. </p>

    <p>- If you do not know the solution of the equation, and it is already very close to the bottom of the screen, just fly into it with your avatar.
        You will lose one life and you won't get points, but you won't lose the game. Whenever any equation goes all the way down,
        you lose all your lives and the game is over.</p>

    <p>- There are two types of bombs in the game: exploding and freezing. The first one, after dragging it to the equation,
        will destroy it requiring player to enter the result. The second one will not destroy it,
        but will freeze: it is best to solve the frozen equation last. Freezing time is not limited.</p>

    <p>5. General rules:</p>
    <p>- Avatar in the game will be the same as your profile image.</p>
    <p>- Solution for ALL equations will be an integer, greater than -50 and smaller than 50.</p>
    <p>- Each level consists of three equations. The number of operands of these equations corresponds to the level.</p>
    <p>- Every three levels, the player receives one of each type of bomb.</p>
    <p>- The best games in terms of points will be saved in the "The Best Players" tab available to see for everyone.</p>
    <p>- Game record will only be saved when player loses all of his hit points.</p>
    <p>6. Controls:</p>
    <p>- Move right/left/up/down: arrows.</p>
    <p>- Type in solution: digits on the keybord and "-" for negative numbers.</p>
    <p>- Shoot solution: "Space bar".</p>
    <p>- Dragging the bombs: Left mouse click and drag, then drop.</p>
